			======

This extension implements an object-oriented Perl interface to the Perforce
SCM System using the API supplied by Perforce software. It's a straight
port of the Perforce API so not very Perl-like. The P4 module (also available
from the Perforce public depot under //guest/tony_smith/perforce/API/P4/...
provides a much more perl-like wrapper on top of this interface. Most people
will want to install that too.

You must download and install the API before you can build this extension.

Get yer API from ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/perforce/rNN.n/bin.XXXXXX

Where NN.n is the release number ( currently 00.2 ) and XXXXX is your
platform.


Build as usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you have problems, see the PORTING file for likely reasons and what
you should do about it.

The file example.pl has a simple example of how to use the modules to
get you started.

NOTE FOR LINUX USERS
--------------------

Users of recent Linux distributions who are using the linux52x86/p4api.tar 
from the Perforce FTP site may get "undefined symbol __eh_pc" when running
"make test".  The problem is caused by changes in the gcc compiler made 
since the version shipped with Red Hat 5.2 which is used for Perforce builds.

If you get this problem, you should use the following API build instead:

	ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/perforce/r00.1/bin.linux60x86/p4api.tar
