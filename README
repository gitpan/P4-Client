This extension implements an object-oriented Perl interface to the Perforce
SCM System using the API supplied by Perforce software.

You must download and install the API before you can build this extension.

Get yer API from ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/perforce/rNN.n/bin.XXXXXX

Where NN.n is the release number ( currently 00.2 ) and XXXXX is your
platform.


Build as usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you have problems, see the PORTING file for likely reasons and what
you should do about it.
