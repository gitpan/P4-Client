		Porting Notes for P4::Client
		============================

So far, I've ported this extension to Linux and FreeBSD, and now Win2K.
It should go pretty cleanly onto almost any Unix platform, particularly
if you're using gcc as your compiler.

The trick is that the files need to be compiled by a C++ compiler instead
of the usual C compiler so you will probably need to copy some of the
stuff from the Linux/FreeBSD hints files to get it going.

If you do port this extension to another platform, please send me the details
of how you got it going ( preferably as a hints file ) and I'll add it
to the distribution for others.
